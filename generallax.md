This is the Generallax Theme for Pico by Shane Zentz.

The Generallax Theme is based on/ported from a plain php/css theme that I created from scratch.  Generallax is simply intended as a boilerplate or starter template, in which the user would (and should) modify the CSS and images to suit their tastes and desires.
